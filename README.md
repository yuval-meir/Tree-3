This repository contains the architecture of Tree-3 model from the paper "Learning on tree architectures outperforms a convolutional feedforward network"
(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27986-6) 

Tree-3 outperforms the LeNet-5 architecture on CIFAR 10, using tree architecture and where each weight in is connected to an output unit via a single route only.

Tree-3 also shown to have a highly pruned BP process.
